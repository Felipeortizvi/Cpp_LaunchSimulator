# C++ Launch Simulator

This will be a C++ project which will allow me to simulate a rocket launch with different variables and will 
determine if you successfully made it out of different orbits of different planets.

# Inputs I would like from user
I want to let the user put the burn time of the rocket, launch angle, scale height, drag coefficient of the rocket.

Additionally, I would like the option change the planet from which we are launching which will change air density and gravitational acceleration on the planet. 

# What I want to implement
I would like to implement OOP principles in C++.
I would like to use pointers effectively.
I am looking to practice inheritance and composition design patterns.
I would like to use unique pointers, and work with different method protection types.

# New Concepts

# How to Compile
