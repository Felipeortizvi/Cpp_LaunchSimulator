# C++ Launch Simulator

This will be a C++ project which will allow me to simulate a rocket launch with different variables and will 
determine if you successfully made it out of different orbits of different planets.

# What I want to implement
I would like to implement OOP principles in C++.
I would like to use pointers effectively.
I am looking to practice inheritance and composition design patterns.
I would like to use unique pointers, and work with different method protection types.

# New Concepts
Header files
Compiling c++ files

# How to Compile
g++ -o LaunchSimulator main.cpp Rocket.cpp Planet.cpp

./LaunchSimulator

Now I would like to know how to do this without having to state all my cpp files, becuase
this seems too complicated as of now.
